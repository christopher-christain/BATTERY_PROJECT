# Battery System Project

This repository contains the code and design for a custom **Battery System automation system**. The goal of this project is to design and build an efficient, scalable battery system that can be used for various applications, such as **energy storage, renewable energy integration,** or **emergency backup power**. The system is designed to be modular, easy to maintain, and flexible to fit different battery configurations, integrated remote battery monitoring system, as well as a smart security system integrated using ulta-sonic sensor.

## Features

- **Battery Management System (BMS)** integration
- **Charging and discharging circuits** with efficient power management
- **Modular design** to support various battery configurations
- **Monitoring** and **status reporting** via real-time data
- **Safety features**, such as over-voltage, under-voltage, and temperature monitoring
- Easy interface for **communication** and **diagnostics**
- integrated remote battery monitoring systems cloud data storage

## Getting Started

To get started with the battery system, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware**:
  - Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or ESP32)
  - Lithium-ion or LiFePO4 battery pack (based on your needs)
  - Battery management system (BMS) (compatible with your chosen battery type)
  - Charging circuit (e.g., MPPT controller for solar integration)
  - Voltage and current sensors
  - Display (e.g., LCD or OLED) for battery status display
  
- **Software**:
  - **Arduino IDE** (or other compatible IDEs based on your microcontroller)
  - **Libraries**: Specific libraries for interfacing with your BMS, sensors, and display modules
  - A **terminal emulator** (for serial communication)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/battery-system.git
   cd battery-system
